GitHub Pages is a good introductory tool for Legal Hacking because it allows you to quickly and easily create websites for free.

To start, all you need to do is create an account in GitHub. You can do this by going to [www.github.com](www.github.com) or by going to [https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)

## Create a Repository

To create a repository in GitHub from the homepage, select the green button for 'New Repository.' From there, you will be asked to give your repository a name, a description, and you will have the option to initialize it with a README file (a file in the repository that describes the work done on the project) and a license (which controls the terms by which information from the repository can be used or shared with others). 

The choice of a license is based on which rights you reserve for yourself. I chose to add the MIT License because I have found it most useful for encouraging collaboration.

When you are finished entering in the information for your repository, click the green button for 'Create Repository.' 

## Create a File

If you selected to create a repository with a README file and a License, those two files will be included in your repository. From here, you are ready to start building. The first step in building a site is creating or editing an existing file, like a README.

The README files that are automatically generated when you create a repository have a '.md' suffix after them. This indicates to GitHub and to everyone else who is working on your project the file format that is involved. If you wanted to add a Microsoft Word file to your repository, you would include the .docx file suffix. If you wanted to add an image file in portable document format, you would include the .pdf file format. And so on...

## Markdown

Files in GitHub can be written using specific programming languages like, for example, Python, Javascript, etc. or they can be written using markdown. When a file has a.MD suffix to it, that allows you to do some unique and interesting things. Essentially, markdown is a syntax for presenting information onto a page. To learn more about how to use markdown, click on this [link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

## Turn On GitHub Pages

The next step covers how to create an instance of your site that faces the public. This is your website! From the homepage of your repository, click 'Settings'
in the upper right hand corner of the page.

Then, scroll down to the header for 'GitHub Pages,' update the source to your 'master branch,' click 'Save,' and select 'Choose a theme.' Once you have selected a suitable theme for your project, based on the design considerations presented in each instance, click 'select' and you will be brought to a now you will have created your website. Commit the changes to your file

## Access Website

Once you have committed your file, click 'Settings' again, scroll down to the header for 'GitHub Pages' again, and there will be a website link for you. Click this website link and you are able to see YOUR website that YOU created.
